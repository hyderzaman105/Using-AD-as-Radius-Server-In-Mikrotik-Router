Subject: Using Active Directory as a RADIUS Server

Dear IT Team,

I am Hyder Zaman, and I have 10 years of experience in the field of Information Technology. I have knowledge related to MikroTik and FreeRADIUS servers on Linux, but today I would like to share how to use Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as a RADIUS server.

If you have experience with AD, thatâ€™s great! Now, you just need to install an additional feature called NPAS (Network Policy and Access Services). It is a powerful feature in Microsoft that, once installed correctly (as shown in the image in my GitHub repository), enables you to configure AD as a RADIUS server.

Here are the details of my setup:

AD IP address: 172.16.0.251
MikroTik IP: 172.16.0.1/24
Feel free to reach out if you need further clarification.

Best regards,
Hyder Zaman
